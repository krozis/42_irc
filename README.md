Project ft_irc from 42 Cursus

### Disclaimer
This project was made with [BW](https://github.com/itzbw). Go visit her Github!

### Project presentation
We have to realise an IRC server following the RFCs rules and real IRC clients must be able to connect to it.

### Specific features
- Our reference client was [Irssi v1.2.3-1ubuntu4](https://irssi.org).
- We added a command POWEROFF, just in order to make server OP not totally useless.
- Several IRC features (NAMES, LIST, MODE +b, WHO,...) were not implemented since it was not asked in the subject.
